The website has 5 filter options to filter the data ![filter_search](https://github.com/NishatSultana3538/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filter_search.png) in where previous filter button ![filter_button](https://github.com/NishatSultana3538/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filter_button.png) was removed.

Using different filter criteria we can get data depending on which filter options we use. We can also use one search field or multiple search field combined to narrow down the result. Using different date only in the Enter date search filed we can get data of different dates UFO sightings. Here are UFO sightings data for different dates.
